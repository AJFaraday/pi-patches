Basically, after some discussion with @gadgetoid on twitter it seems there is a real interest amongst hardware hackers in using Pure Data as a tool to instantly sonify the result of human inputs, but there appears to be something of a skilsl gap. 

The patches held within are fairly straight-forward pure data patches with customisable input to allow this to take place.
